                        perform at some of the world's biggest and best festivals, clubs, events and shows. One of
                        the highlights of 2010 was Armin's DJ set at the Museumplein in Amsterdam in July, during
                        the honouring of the Dutch soccer team. Even though the national team lost in the FIFA
                        Worldcup, they partied like they were the absolute winners, and so did the 200.000 strong
                        crowd. Sold-out shows for Armin Only in 2005 and 2006 created eager anticipation of the

                        attended and were enthralled by the DJ’s nine-hour set, under the name of ‘Imagine’. For his
                        fourth artist album, ‘Mirage’, Armin will kick off another Armin Only World tour. After the
                        first show in the sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht on November 13th, Armin will continue to

                    <p>Dedicated, hardworking, and energetic – three words that are probably the best attempt to
                        briefly describe what the Norwegian hot-shot Ørjan Nilsen is about. In the last few years,
                        he has been wowing audiences across the planet with his take on what a 21st century DJ and
                        producer should be about. Born in 1982 in the Norwegian town of Kirkenes, Ørjan has had very
                        little doubt about what he wanted to do with his life, having listened to countless CD
                        compilations, and seeing some of the legends DJing, Ørjan knew that the DJ booth would be
                        his domain one day.Ørjans work with the dutch label Armada Music started with the track “Red
                        Woods” released in 2006 under his DJ Governor alias, and over the years Ørjan found his
                        groove, flashing samples of his huge potential, with “La Guitarra”(2008), Lovers Lane and So
                        Long Radio (2010). Ørjan went on to release his first artist album in 2011 titled “In My
                        Opinion” which stormed up sales charts and catapultedØrjan onto the watch-list of every
                        EDM-fan around. Even though “In My Opinion” was very successful, Ørjanshowed no intention of
                        slowing down, quickly releasing mammoth tracks like “Viking”, “Atchoo” (2011) and opening
                        2012 in collaboration with Armin van Buuren and the aptly titled “Belter” followed by his
                        own “Amsterdam” and“Endymion” before finishing out the year with club
                        destroyers“Copperfield” and “Filthy Fandango”.As a DJ Ørjan Nilsen quickly established
                        himself with an infectious blend of all things chunky and groovy, his energy and presence
                        behind the decks have taken him around the world playing at some of the world’s finest clubs
                        and biggest festivals, from Sao Paulo to Sydney and many places in between. It has been a
                        remarkable journey that resulted in recognition from industry heavyweights. One thing is
                        certain, there is no stopping this Norwegian prodigy, as he is on a mission, be it in the
                        studio or the DJ booth, Ørjan Nilsen is determined to surprise, amaze and entertain, and you
                        would not want to miss out.</p>

                    <p>Markus Schulz (born 3 February 1975), is a German-American DJ and music producer based in
                        Miami, Florida. Best known for his weekly radio show titled Global DJ Broadcast that airs on
                        Digitally Imported radio, After Hours FM and other online stations, Schulz is also the
                        founder of the label Coldharbour Recordings and Schulz Music Group (SMG), an artist
                        management company that manages rising stars in the industry including Nifra, Fisherman &
                        Hawkins, Mr. Pit, Grube & Hovsepian, and Adina Butar. In September 2012, Schulz was crowned
                        America's Number 1 DJ by DJ Times.

                        Over the last 10 years, Markus Schulz has coalesced the individual musical identities of
                        progressive, trance & house into his creative hybrid sound. Through a unique alignment of
                        headlining DJ sets, Armada and Coldharbour label output and his highly prominent Global DJ
                        Broadcast radio show, he's been at the forefront of the revolution on the US EDM scene. This
                        success has been reflected in weekly sets spun in front of many tens of thousands, a GDJB
                        listenership up in the millions & one Beatport chart smash after another. Following several
                        highly ranked positions, in 2008 Schulz broke into the Top 10 of DJ Mag's Top 100 chart.
                        He's remained there for the last four straight years (polling #9 in 2011) and now stands as
                        the busiest international DJ playing out of the United States. Markus Schulz - The DJ:
                        Through his natural audience interaction, flawless harmonic mixing, intuitive tune selection
                        and now famous open-till-close sets, he has wowed crowds in every major metropolis. Schulz's
                        DJ career has run largely parallel to that of his productions. In the early noughties,
                        having concentrated on the hinterland between trance & progressive, he began to reach
                        audiences further and further afield. His career received a significant boost when, in 2004,
                        he signed with heavyweight DJ agency, David Lewis Productions (also home to Armin van
                        Buuren). Now a regular fixture at the world's biggest & most famous clubs, arenas and
                        festivals, he lays down his inimitable trance-progressive vision every week. In Europe, he's
                        smashed Transmission, Nature One, Dance Valley, Electronic Family, Sunrise and Tomorrowland;
                        worked tent-pegs-loose at Creamfields; gridlocked Global Gatherings and played
                        open-till-close sets at Space, Miami, Avalon, LA and Amnesia, Ibiza. Stateside the colossal
                        Electric Daisy, Nocturnal, and Ultra Festivals have all felt Schulz pressure and yet further
                        afield still he's engineered floor uproar across South East Asia and Australia. Schulz has
                        polled 4 consecutive years inside DJ Mag's world's top 10, is regularly ranked in the FTB,
                        Trance Addict and Trance Podium charts as trance's 2nd biggest spinner and won Best American
                        DJ at the 2008 IDMAs. How It Began: Born in Eschwege, central Germany, Markus emigrated to
                        the United States. Age 13, his dance music awakening came during the grip of the country's
                        then-nascent breakdance scene. His early production and DJ career roughly tracked that of
                        the second Stateside House explosion and he caught his first production break in 1993 when
                        he remixed Sagat's 'Why Is It? (F** Dat)' for FFrr. Markus' freshman production release
                        followed in 1994 with the 6-track 'Plastik Trax EP Vol 1'. Throughout the mid to late
                        Nineties, he continued to accrue acclaim with a range of releases on numerous luminary U.S.
                        labels. In 1998 he recorded 'You Won't See Me Cry' for Plastik Records (his first label),
                        which was picked up by the UK's Eve Records and became his first non-domestic release.
                        Coldharbour Recordings: Schulz's sound notably came quickest to the ears of European DJs.
                        Following the formation of the Armada group in 2005, Armin sought Markus out and asked him
                        to start compiling tracks for a new vinyl series. The Coldharbour Sessions EPs launched in
                        2004 (with the first 3 releases coming out on the already established Electronic Elements
                        label). In succession, they resoundingly impacted on dancefloors and within 12 months
                        Coldharbour the label came into existence. Named after Markus' then-production base in
                        London's Coldharbour Lane, its output immediately brought a new sound-type to Armada's
                        repertoire. It also became a lightning rod for a new generation of prog-inclined producers -
                        setting in motion the careers of (amongst others) Santiago Nino, Rex Mundi, Mark Otten &
                        Niklas Harding. With 2005 under the spell of Coldharbour's more refined, minimal yet still
                        melodic take on the trance sound Markus struck again with the first Coldharbour Sessions mix
                        compilation. Such has been the success of the imprint that in 2007 it was joined by
                        sub-label Coldharbour Red. This, in turn, became the launchpad for the careers of Marcus
                        Schössow, tyDi, Glenn Morrison & Evol Waves and was the point of re-entry for early Schulz
                        side-project, Dakota (see the section below). In August 2010 it celebrated its 100th release
                        with Schulz's cover of Cass & Slide's 'Perception'. Seven years after its birth, Coldharbour
                        stands among the top tier of trance & progressive labels. Getting regular props from the
                        press, in 2011 DJ Mag stated that it was: "an imprint in the rudest of good health!" while
                        Mixmag said: "Coldharbour is a label fair brimming with ready-to-break production talent".
                        M.S. Productions 2005 - 2009: Perfectly intersecting the quality/quantity axis, Markus'
                        productions have been fundamental components in marshaling clubbers and music lovers to his
                        sound. Throughout the last half-decade singles like 'First Time' & 'Without You Near'
                        (2005), 'Fly To Colours', 'Never Be The Same' & 'I Am' (2007) 'Perfect' & 'Cause You Know'
                        (2008) & most recently anthems like 'The New World' & 'Do You Dream?' have each played their
                        vital part. Markus is also a regular production collaborator. In 2005 he famously teamed up
                        with likeminded producers Gabriel & Dresden and Departure for 'Without You Near' and did the
                        same with Andy Moor on 'Daydream' and Max Graham on 'Goodbye'. The impact of all the singles
                        has been catalyzed throughout the period by his studio albums 'Without You Near' (2005) and
                        'Progression' (2007). M.S. Productions 2010 - 2012 - 'Do You Dream': In February 2010,
                        Schulz completed the principle recording of his third long-player, 'Do You Dream?' The
                        16-track album was released on June the 15th in many key territories. Its release prompted
                        Tilllate Magazine to say it was "energetic" & "exhilarating", whilst DJ Mag said: "it's hard
                        to see why you won't completely adore this". On April 1st, 2011 the album's remix edition
                        was released. It included track remakes from heavyweights including Ferry Corsten, Cosmic
                        Gate & Super8 & Tab, as well as core Coldharbour artists, inc. Tucandeo, Mr. Pit and Mike
                        Foyle. The remix edition was followed a month later by Schulz's first DVD release in May
                        '11, which documented his 'Do You Dream?' round-the-world tour. October 2011 saw Schulz
                        begin work on his fourth, as yet untitled artist album. It was announced in March of 2012
                        that 'Go!' - a collaboration with fellow German producer Dennis Shepard, would be the first
                        single to appear from it. Markus Schulz Pres. Dakota: Markus has only made rare use of
                        pseudonyms throughout his career - seeing them only as valuable if they represented an
                        outlet for something other than his established sound. At the turn of the millennium, he
                        released 3 tracks ('Swirl', 'Frozen' & 'Lost in Brixton') under the alias, Dakota. Over time
                        the tracks became first-contact points for many new fans. In 2009 Schulz paid dues to that
                        by resurrecting the guise, recalibrating its sound and directed his attentions to a whole
                        album of material. 'Thoughts Become Things' was the result and it became a route diversion
                        that branched out to embrace techno, house, and other sub-genres. It swelled both Schulz's
                        fanbase and the range of DJ support for his music. The album justified 7 single releases
                        that have included particular fan-favorites 'Chinook', 'Johnny the Fox', 'Koolhaus' & 'Mr.
                        Cappuccino'. Such was its success in July of 2011 he followed it up with the sequel -
                        'Thoughts Become Things II'. Giving it their prized Album of the Month award, MIXMAG said:
                        "With 'Thoughts II' Schulz's Dakota guise could be about to take centrestage", while DJ Mag
                        noted it contained "lush riffs at a housier tempo" and was "epic stuff". Further afield
                        America's DJ Times wrote: "every track pushes great sounds and solid club vibes that throw
                        you off your feet", whilst Germany's Raveline said that: "no DJ should miss out on the
                        techier, darker and more progressive side of the Schulz sound". To date, it has spawned 5
                        singles ('Sinners', 'Sleepwalkers', Katowice' and the AA 'In A Green Valley'/'Saints'), as
                        well as a remix edition with reworks from Arnej, KhoMha, Mr. Pit, Wellenrausch and others.
                        The Global DJ Broadcast show: Now in its sixth year Schulz's GDJB has continued to be a
                        beacon for an always-growing throng of trance & progressive dance fans. Having begun life on
                        Miami's Party 93.1 station, it is now broadcast through DI.fm and Sirius/XM satellite, the
                        Global DJ Broadcast site and over 50 other FM stations around the planet. Based on a regular
                        format, the first show of each month is a two-hour-long mix from one of Schulz's rolling
                        World Tour gigs - ones that have of late included Medellin, Columbia, St Petersberg, Russia
                        & Amnesia in Ibiza. Subsequent shows in the month feature Markus mixing his broad span pick
                        of the current electronic dance music best for an hour (which includes the forum-voted
                        Global Selection track of the week) followed by guest mixes from both established and
                        up-and-coming DJs. Markus Schulz - The City Albums: Markus is also responsible for one of
                        the longest-running and respected compilation album series in trance history. Providing this
                        microcosmic view of his sound, the albums have become cornerstones for fan collections, with
                        each travelogue edition bringing in a fresh wave of supporters. Notably, the Amsterdam '08
                        release was nominated for an IDMA award for Best Full-Length DJ Mix (in the same year that
                        he took home the trophy for Best American DJ). Kicking off in 2005 with Miami, it moved to
                        Ibiza in '06, Amsterdam in '08 and Toronto in '09. The following year Schulz was "notably
                        ahead of the curve" (Mixmag) with Las Vegas'10 release, presaging the city's EDM rise by 12
                        months. In 2011 he focused on dance music's surge in popularity in Eastern Europe with
                        Prague'11, before returning to the States for his most recent edition. 'Los Angeles '12'
                        captured the establishment of EDM as a dominant mainstream force in the American music
                        scene. In giving it their Album of the Month, Mixmag said: "Schulz demonstrates his
                        understanding of the uncompromising sounds that hold sway over LA's clubs and arenas".
                        Remixes: Markus started his remix career in the early 90s with a 30-strong volley of
                        high-profile reworks. Over the decade, he re-tooled the production works of Euro dominators
                        like The Real McCoy & Technotronic, house masters & divas including Armand van Helden & Liz
                        Torres, legendary Nineties icons RuPaul, Bette Midler & Sandra Bernhard and fully-fledged
                        A-listers like Madonna (on Love Don't Live Here Anymore). As the Millennium arrived he began
                        to work on deeper, more intrinsically electronic dance fare... In 2000 he remixed trance
                        innovator Pablo Gargano's 'Absolution', PQM's Renaissance classic 'The Flying Song' and
                        Fatboy Slim's 'Sunset (Bird of Prey). Satisfied that he'd found the right dance strata to
                        focus on Markus has gone on to rewire tracks by Oceanlab, Motorcycle, Dance 2 Trance, Cosmic
                        Gate, Nalin & Kane, Kyau & Albert, John O'Callaghan, & Space Manoeuvres amongst many, many
                        others.</p>
