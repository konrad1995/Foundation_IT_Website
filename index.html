            <h1>What is Trance?</h1>
        </center>
        <div class="main">
        
            <p> Trance is a genre of electronic music that emerged from the British new-age music scene and the
                early
                1990s German techno and hardcore scenes. At the same time trance music was developing in Europe, the
                genre
                was also gathering a following in the Indian state of Goa.
            </p>
            <P>Trance music is characterized by a tempo lying between 110–150 bpm (BPM), repeating melodic phrases
                and
                a
                musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1
                to 2
                "peaks"
                or "drops". Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other
                musical
                styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient and film music.
            </p>
            <p>
                A trance is a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness. This is portrayed in trance music by
                the
                mixing
                of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release. A common characteristic of trance music
                is
                a
                mid-song
                climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely,leaving the melody or
                atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again. Trance tracks
                are
                often
                lengthy to allow for such progression and commonly have sufficiently sparse opening and closing
                sections
                to
                facilitate mixing by DJs.
            </p>
            <p>Trance is mostly instrumental, although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by
                mezzo-soprano
                to soprano female soloists, often without a traditional verse/chorus structure. Structured vocal
                form in
                trance
                music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre, which has been described as "grand, soaring, and
                operatic"
                and "ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths". However, male singers, such as Jonathan
                Mendelsohn,
                are also featured.

                <h2>History</h2>
            </center>
            <p>The "Trance" name may refer to an induced emotional feeling, high, euphoria, chills, or uplifting
                rush
                that listeners claim to experience, or it may indicate an actual trance-like state the earliest
                forms of this
                music attempted to emulate in the 1990s before the genre's focus changed. A writer for Billboard
                magazine writes,
                Trance music is perhaps best described as a mixture of 70s disco and 60s psychedelia”.</p>
            <p>
                Another possible antecedent is Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima's electronic soundtracks for the
                Streets of Rage series of video games from 1991 to 1994. It was promoted by the
                well-known UK club-night "Megatripolis" (London, at Heaven on Thursdays) whose scene catapulted it
                to international fame.

                Examples of early trance releases include but are not limited to KLF's 1988 release "What Time Is
                Love?" (Pure Trance 1), German duo Dance 2 Trance's 1990 track "We Came in Peace", and German
                duo Jam & Spoon's 1992 12" Single remix of the 1990 song "The Age Of Love".</P>
            <P>
                The writer Bom Coen traces the roots of trance to Paul van Dyk's 1993 remix of Humate's "Love
                Stimulation". However, Van Dyk's trance origins can be traced further back to his work with
                Visions of Shiva, being the first tracks he released In subsequent years, one genre, vocal
                trance, arose as the combination of progressive elements and pop music, and the development of
                another subgenre, epic trance, finds some of its origins in classical music, with film music also
                being influential.

                Trance was arguably at its commercial peak in the second part of 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
