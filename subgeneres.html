        <h2>
            <li>Acid trance</li>
        </h2>

        <p>Acid trance is a genre of trance music that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s focusing on using the
            acid
            sound. The trademark sound of "acid" is produced with a Roland TB-303 by playing a sequenced melody while
            altering the instrument's filter cutoff frequency, resonance, envelope modulation, and accent controls. This
            real-time tone adjustment was not part of the instrument's original intended operation. Acid trance is the
            best
            known form of trance music in Belgium. The form was first showcased at the popular Antwerp Rave 24 in
            Belgium,
            and has created four national number one singles in the country since.</p>

        <p>Acid trance may be considered a descendant of acid house, since the genre of trance had not yet been invented
            during the advent of acid house (or acidhouse).</p>

        <p>
            The first volumes of Trancemaster compilations contains a few tracks in acid trance style, just as classic
            trance tracks. The difference is, while acid trance tracks focus more on the changing TB-303 lines, classic
            trance (e.g. Dance 2 Trance, Cosmic Baby, Age of Love, and Jam & Spoon) tracks are more atmospheric, they
            use
            "softer" synth-lines, often strings and other ambient music elements. The line between these two styles is
            quite
            blurred; they also emerged about the same time.
        </p>

        <P>Acid Trance artists are often grouped with their classical and Goa counterparts. It is not uncommon to see
            many
            of the first Acid Trance artists featured on Goa Trance compilation albums. However, some of these
            artists[who?]
            never considered themselves part of the Goa or Psychedelic scene and these compilation albums were often
            done by
            their record labels who published Acid Trance alongside Goa artists.</P>

        <h2>
            <li>Dream trance</li>
        </h2>

        <p>Dream trance is an early subgenre of trance music that peaked prominently on the international dance scene
            between 1995 and 1998 (colliding with the first time for trance to reach mainstream). The "dream" term has
            been
            known to largely influence house music in general, and therefore the subgenre is also known as dream house
            or
            dream dance on some occasions.

        </P>
        <p>Today, dream trance is considered to be the first and the most primitive derivative of the Progressive house
            movement that started around 1992. Many psytrance producers emergent at the time (notably Infected Mushroom)
            were also influenced by it.</p>


        <h2>
            <li>Futurepop</li>
        </h2>

        <p>Futurepop is an electronic music genre, an outgrowth of EBM, that evolved in the late 1990s with groups like VNV
            Nation, Covenant, and Apoptygma Berzerk. It is characterized by the heavy use of sampling and an absence of
            vocal modification that is popular in many other forms of electronic music, such as Aggrotech.</p>

        <h2>
            <li>Goa trance</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
        
        Goa trance is an electronic music style that originated during the late 1980s in Goa, India. Goa trance
        often has funky, drone-like basslines, similar to the techno minimalism of 21st century psytrance. Psychedelic
        trance developed from Goa trance.
    </p>

        <h2>
            <li>Hardstyle</li>
        </h2>
<p> Hardstyle is a Dutch electronic dance genre mixing influences from techno and hardcore. Early hardstyle
    typically consisted of an overdriven and hard-sounding kick drum with much sustain, with intense faded or
    reversed basslines accompanying the beat. Hardstyle also utilises harsh and distorted synths, detuned and
    distorted sounds accompanying the main instruments along with many modern hardstyle songs that also incorporate
    poetry and story telling within the music.</p>
       
        <p>The natural evolution of music has seen hardstyle mellow out over time. What was once a very dark, assertive and
            powerful genre began to incorporate uplifting trance-like synths and melodies. Modern kicks are also now
            layered, with multiple layers of higher frequency distorted kicks, combining with a lower frequency tremble to
            create a thicker and fuller kick drum. During the mid- to late 2000s, pitching kicks became popular in hardstyle
            as well, often utilizing the kick drum as the bass, as opposed to a bass synth. All this has led to hardstyle
            becoming more accessible and popularity increased. Many hardcore artists produce hardstyle tracks as well, and
            many newer hardstyle tracks are written in compound time (for example, older Headhunterz and Noisecontrollers
            work).</p>
        
<p>
        Hardstyle has also been an influence on other styles of electronic dance music as well, most notably big room
        house, which shares similarities with hardstyle like structures, rhythms, and later, pitched kicks.</p>

        <h2>
            <li>Eurodance</li>
        </h2>

        <p>Eurodance (sometimes known as Euro-NRG, Euro-electronica or Euro) is a genre of electronic dance music that
        originated in the late 1980s in Europe. It combines many elements of hip hop, techno,[3] Hi-NRG,[1] house
        music[1] and Euro disco.[2]</p>

        <p>This genre of music is heavily influenced by the use of rich melodic vocals, either exclusively by itself or
        inclusively with rapped verses. This, combined with cutting-edge synthesizers, strong bass rhythm and melodic
        hooks, establishes the core foundation of Eurodance music.[2]</p>

        <h2>
            <li>Hard trance</li>
        </h2>
        <p>

        earliest known Balearic trance compositions date back to a few years after the emergence of Balearic beat in the
        1990s.</p>

        With a beat and a bassline faster to the house (134-142 BPM), the songs are long and have an interesting
        construction where different elements are brought gradual and gentle way (hence the name of this style). First
        down compared to the Uplifting, this style has become the style of Trance most likely at the end of the decade
        2000-2010</p>
