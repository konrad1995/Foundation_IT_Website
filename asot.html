                        Trance music. The show won the title of ‘Best Mix Radio Show’ at the International Dance Music
                        Awards in Miami for an unprecedented seven times and continues to provide Trance fans with the
                        hottest new tunes, a Future Favorite, Tune Of The Week, Progressive Pick and Service For

                        where the magic happens.</p>
                    <p>
                        The show takes the format of a two-hour mix in which Armin plays new trance music (uplifting
                        trance,
                        vocal trance, and progressive trance), both promotional and commercially released. All tracks
                        are
                        announced during the show. The show has its own website, which enables fans to converse in
                        chat-rooms and forums, such as Digitally Imported while listening to the broadcast. The success
                        of
                        the show has also spawned to include several dance events around the world. The show is
                        celebrated
                        live each year in different locations around the globe with a lineup consisting of many trance
                        artists.[1]

                    <p>
                        The first episode (000) was aired on 18 May 2001 (Friday) on ID&T Radio. On 1 June 2001 (Friday)
                        episode 001 was broadcast and their weekly broadcasts began. Since episode 017, it airs on
                        Thursdays.

                    <p>

                        Episode 182 was the last to air on ID&T Radio as the show was canceled unexpectedly after the
                        station decided to change its music policy. Episode 183 was aired a month later, through the
                        Internet radio station ETN.fm. To better adapt to an international audience, Armin went from
                        presenting in Dutch to presenting in English.

                    <p>
                        From episode 185, the show went from ETN.fm to DI.fm and began to synchronize on many national
                        radio
                        stations.

                        Record label (2003–present)
                        A State of Trance was formed in 2003 as a sub-label to its Dutch parent company Armada Music.
                        The
                        style of released music is mainly trance and progressive trance. The label is focusing on both
                        young
                        producers (such as Filo & Peri, 8 Wonders, Robert Nickson, and Galen Behr) as well as
                        established
                        artists (like Markus Schulz, Sunlounger, Sean Tyas, Signum and Vincent de Moor). It released its
                        first vinyl release in 2003 with "Questia - Nexus Asia"[4] and reached its 100 release (ASOT100)
                        with "The Doppler Effect – Beauty Hides in the Deep / Envio – For You (The Blizzard Remix)" in
                        June
                        2008.[5]

                        Radio show's legacy
                        While it was not the first radio show to broadcast a two-hour mix from a recurring DJ, A State
                        of
                        Trance's legacy has extended beyond the trance scene. Part of this may be due to the fact that
                        for
                        most parts of the world, A State of Trance was only accessible via Digitally Imported, an
                        internet
                        radio station. Since A State of Trance has gone on the air, numerous DJ's have created their own
                        radio programs similar to A State of Trance. Some of which include, Above & Beyond with Trance
                        Around the World (now rebranded as Group Therapy), Aly & Fila with the Future Sound of Egypt,
                        and
                        Markus Schulz with the Global DJ Broadcast. Some radio shows that don't even play trance music
                        have
                        spawned out of the spirit of A State of Trance (such as Carl Cox's Global, Hardwell on Air, and
                        Nicky Romero's Protocol).

                        Special episodes and celebrating events
                        Although the program usually takes the format of a mixture of two hours in which the latest
                        musical
                        developments are presented, special episodes are also made such as anniversary broadcasts,
                        programs
                        in which the Tune of the Year is chosen, the Yearmix, broadcasts of recorded or live sessions,
                        as
                        well as various specials (such as episode 666).

                    <p>
                        The 100th episode was a 5 hours special show, with guestmixes and the best tunes of the 100
                        episodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 200th episode was a 4 hours special show, with the most requested songs by listeners,
                        Gabriel &
                        Dresden guestmix, and one hour of live show from Amsterdam.

                    <p>
                        Since 250th and every 50th episode of the show there are some celebrations with some trance DJs
                        that
                        plays live. Since 400th episode these celebrations have place in different countries.

                        In March 2011, during the Ultra Music Festival, A State of Trance was given its own stage as
                        part of
                        its 500th episode tour. This was the first time a radio show was given its own tent at a music
                        festival, along with its own broadcast, separate from the festival's official broadcast.
                        Typically a
                        festival stage is hosted by either a particular style of music, or a record label. Since Ultra
                        2011,
                        A State of Trance has had its own arena at Ultra and the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas.

                    <p>
                        Since 500th episode, A State of Trance's annual episodic celebrations have effectively replaced
                        Trance Energy (later simply called Energy, focusing on electro house instead of trance) as the
                        main
                        trance event in the Netherlands, where every year the biggest of these celebrations takes place.

                        The Service for Dreamers (From episode 284 to 769, it was known as ASOT Radio Classic and
                        between
                        episode 770 and 799 as Armin's Oldskool Classic). Armin selects a track from past years and
                        briefly
                        describes what made the track a classic. Armin also played a classic track on each of the first
                        16
                        episodes in the early days of the radio show. These tracks were productions from the 1990s and
                        showcased some of the very earliest pioneers of the Trance genre.

                        the stipulation that the track not be a track already played on ASOT as a Classic.
