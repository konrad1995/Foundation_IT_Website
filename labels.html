                    <p>Black Hole Recordings is a Dutch record label founded by Tijs Verwest (Tiësto) and Arny Bink in

                        Entertainment Distribution. In August 2009, Tiësto decided to part ways with Black Hole

                        Group.</p>
                    <p>In late 1994, Tiësto signed to Basic Beat where he met Arny Bink, Tiësto released records on the
                        sub-label Trashcan, founded by Arny, and later created the Guardian Angel sub-label with Arny in
                        which they introduced the popular Forbidden Paradise series. In the fall of 1997, Bink and
                        Tiësto decided to leave Basic Beat and create their own parent label, Black Hole Recordings,
                        Trashcan was discontinued and Guardian Angel continued releasing music until 2002. Through Black
                        Hole, Tiësto released the Magik series and also created two major sub-labels; SongBird and In
                        Trance We Trust. From 1998 to 1999 Tiësto released music on Planetary Consciousness where he met
                        A&R Hardy Heller and invited him to release some records on Black Hole. Tiësto later included
                        the In Search of Sunrise series on Songbird and opened a new division of Black Hole, Magik
                        Muzik, which was established in 2001. Magik Muzik was the home of the major chart-topping songs
                        by Tiësto, the sub-label began releasing exclusive material but has expanded since then.</p>

                    <p>Anjunabeats /ænˈdʒuːnəbiːts/ is a British record label started by producers Jonathan "Jono" Grant
                        and Paavo Siljamäki of Above & Beyond in 2000. Initially exclusively a trance music label,
                        around 2011 Anjunabeats started releasing primarily trance-edged house.[1] The name Anjuna comes
                        from the name of a beach in Goa, India.</p>
                    <p>In 2000, Anjunabeats released its first 12" record, titled Volume One, which was released under
                        Grant and Siljamäki's alias Anjunabeats.[citation needed] As the label got the name Anjunabeats,
                        they decided to produce under different aliases, such as Free State and Dirt Devils. They were
                        soon
                        joined by Tony McGuinness to form Above & Beyond.[citation needed]</p>

                    <p> 2005, Above & Beyond launched the sub-label Anjunadeep aimed at releases that don't fit under
                        the
                        main label's trance focus, allowing more diversity within Anjunabeats.[citation needed] The trio
                        also launched 2 other sub-labels, Anjunadigital that deals with special remixes and releases of
                        Anjunabeats and Anjunadeep tracks, and Hard On Recordings that was active from 2000 to 2004 and
                        focused on hard trance and hard house.</p>

                    <p>On 3 October 2017, Anjunabeats announced a collaboration with Beatport to host a production
                        competition titled "Beats In School", in which the winner will earn a year-long mentorship with
                        Anjunabeats artists. Canadian Joel Freck was named as the winner on 10 January 2018, among 20
                        contest finalists. </p>

                    <P>In March 2018, Anjunabeats launched a 24/7 radio station on YouTube, which will feature tracks
                        from
                        their label discography including trance and deep house.</P>
